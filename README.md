# Full Stack - Technical Assessment

Our tech teams are curious, driven, intelligent, pragmatic, collaborative and open-minded and you should be too.

## Testing Goals

We are testing your ability to rapidly prototype an application underpinned by good software engineering practises. This should demonstrate a broad range of skills within a full stack (front end, mid-tier and backend) from a blank canvas. You will need to use your intellect, creativity, judgement and be comfortable making decisions to produce a solution. Your solution does not need to be a complete application, but should demonstrate you understand how to build software with good software engineering practises.

You will have approximately 1 week to complete this task. You can use as much or as little time as you deem necessary to demonstrate your understanding of the problem, your range of skills and approach to problem solving.

Some successful candidates have spent as little as 3 hours whilst others have used the full week because they've enjoyed exploring different ideas, technologies and approaches.

## The Task

You are required to build a prototype healthcare application that presents a summary of the patients care record to a clinician in a healthcare setting using the data provided.

You will have approximately 1 week to complete this task and should focus on an Minimum Viable Product (MVP), but you are free to take this as far as you wish.

## The Solution

Your MVP can use any of the following technologies along with **any frameworks or libraries you feel appropriate**:

- **Frontend** - TypeScript/JavaScript, React / Angular (Preferably React).
- **Middleware Programming Languages** - Java / Python / JavaScript / TypeScript.
- **DBs** - MongoDB / MySql / Postgres / SQLServer Express / Filesystem.

You should containerise your application using docker / docker-compose.

## Context

[FHIR](/https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) is a popular standard within healthcare used by healthcare systems to exchange data and represent details of patients in a standardised way. Some sample FHIR data has been generated in the `data` directory using a tool called [synthea](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html).

As FHIR is a standard there may be many libraries and UI widgets you can use freely. Google is your friend.

## Submit your solution

Create a public GitHub repository and push your solution including any documentation you feel necessary. Commit often - we would rather see a history of trial and error than a single monolithic push. When you're finished, please send us the URL to the repository.
